PROBLEM STATEMENT-

. Application to demonstrate:
Client and Server Programs in which server process creates a shared memory segment and writes the
message to the shared memory segment. Client process reads the message from the shared memory
segment and displays it to the screen.


//CODE
//Program for Receiver:
CODE:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/shm.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
int i;
void *shared_memory;
char buff[100];
int shmid;
shmid=shmget((key_t)2345, 1024, 0666);
printf("Key of shared memory is %d\n",shmid);
shared_memory=shmat(shmid,NULL,0); //process attached to shared
memory segment
printf("Process attached at %p\n",shared_memory);
printf("Data read from shared memory is : %s\n",(char *)shared_memory);
}
OUTPUT:
Key of shared memory is -1
Process attached at 0xffffffffffffffff
