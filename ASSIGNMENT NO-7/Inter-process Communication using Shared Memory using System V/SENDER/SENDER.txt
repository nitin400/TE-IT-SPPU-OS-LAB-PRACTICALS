PROBLEM STATEMENT

. Application to demonstrate:
Client and Server Programs in which server process creates a shared memory segment and writes the
message to the shared memory segment. Client process reads the message from the shared memory
segment and displays it to the screen.


//CODE



#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/shm.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
int i;
void *shared_memory;
char buff[100];
int shmid;
shmid=shmget((key_t)2345, 1024, 0666|IPC_CREAT); //creates shared
memory segment with key 2345, having size 1024 bytes. IPC_CREAT is used
to create the shared segment if it does not exist. 0666 are the permisions on the
shared segment
printf("Key of shared memory is %d\n",shmid);
shared_memory=shmat(shmid,NULL,0); //process attached to shared
memory segment
printf("Process attached at %p\n",shared_memory); //this prints the address
where the segment is attached with this process
printf("Enter some data to write to shared memory\n");
read(0,buff,100); //get some input from user
strcpy(shared_memory,buff); //data written to shared memory
printf("You wrote : %s\n",(char *)shared_memory);
}
OUTPUT:-
Key of shared memory is 0
Process attached at 0x7f3cb28e1000
Enter some data to write to shared memory
