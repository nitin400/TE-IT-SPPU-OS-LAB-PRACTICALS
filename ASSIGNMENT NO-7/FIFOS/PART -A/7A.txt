PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
	Full duplex communication between two independent processes. First process accepts
sentences and writes on one pipe to be read by second process and second process counts number of
characters, number of words and number of lines in accepted sentences, writes this output in a text file
and writes the contents of the file on second pipe to be read by first process and displays on standard
output.


//CODE:-

#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/stat.h>
#include<fcntl.h>
#define Max_Buff 1024

int main()
{
	int fd1,fd2,c=0;
	char * myfifo1="myfifo1";
	char * myfifo2="myfifo2";
	
	
	char buff[Max_Buff];
	char str;
	int res;
	
	res=mkfifo(myfifo1,0777);
	if(res==-1)
	{
		printf("\nPipe 1 not created");
		return 0;
	}
	
	printf("\nEnter the string\n");
	fd1=open(myfifo1,O_WRONLY);
	while((str=getchar())!='#')
	buff[c++]=str;
	buff[c]='\0';
	
	write(fd1,buff,sizeof(buff));
	close(fd1);
	
	fd2=open(myfifo2,O_RDONLY);
	read(fd2,&buff,Max_Buff);
	
	printf("\nContents of files:\n %s",buff);
	close(fd2);
	unlink(myfifo2);
	
	return 0;
